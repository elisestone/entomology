# entomology
Understanding how certain entomology devices performs in field conditions is crucial for estimating the success of their survival.  In this dummy database, we have temperature data collected inside each device as well as a performance assessment carried out after a certain time of exposure in the field. The performance metrics collected are quality of the device (where 0 means poor and 100 very good quality); Number of Healthy Insects (where 100 is the maximum); Group, that refers to the configuration of each device; Cost per Device (R$) is the individual cost of each single device.  In the coordinates tab, you can find each single box location when deployed in the field.
